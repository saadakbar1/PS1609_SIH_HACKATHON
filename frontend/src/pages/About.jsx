          The project involves developing an Alumni Association platform for NSUT, featuring both web and mobile applications. The platform will enable alumni registration, donations, networking, job searches, and tracking alumni success stories. It will also offer tools for event management, surveys, and feedback collection, aimed at fostering engagement, career growth, and a strong alumni community. Through these features, the platform will create a dynamic and supportive ecosystem, helping alumni stay connected, contribute, and thrive.
